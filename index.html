             Welcome to Kizii Art Gallery<br><br>
    How does your brand differ from your competitors? <br>
    Your website’s homepage is your <br>
    chance to let your individuality shine through. <br>
    This should reflect throughout the design and <br>
     copy on your homepage. For example, if you’re an educational <br>
     platform, perhaps you could use <br>
     photos of people in the classroom. If you have a law firm website, <br>
    you’ll probably want to use a professional <br>
    tone of voice, as well as the relevant jargon.<br>
